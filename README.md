First thank you for taking the time and emotional energy to witness my first solo game project.  It’s dark, like a very dark night, like the winter solstice. 

Content Warning all the things every terrible thing (spiders, death, suicide, self harm, infidelity, stalking, assault, more.) Also I have needed to reassure others who have played it (of the handful) that I am doing okay and safe -to-self and working on this project is helping me feel better than I was.
